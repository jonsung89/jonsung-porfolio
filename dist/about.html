        <p>I'm a full-stack developer specialized in JavaScript, Node/Express, React/Redux, MongoDB/PostgreSQL with three years of work experience in IT.<br /><br />
        After being introduced to programming in 2017, I quickly fell in love with it. I enrolled in CS50: Intro to Computer Science at Harvard online that summer and began to teach myself Python and Swift/iOS development.
        Soon after, I realized that programming/software development was my passion and decided to enroll in the full-time
        Engineering Immersion program with Thinkful to build a strong foundation in full-stack web development. <br /><br />
        Currently, I am graduated from Thinkful and continuously expanding my skills by learning new technologies and implementing them to my new personal projects while assisting as a Thinkful teaching assistant at web development and data science meetup events here in Minneapolis.</p>

        <p>Learn to Code | Thinkful Minneapolis meetup group is sponsored by Thinkful and was created to help people in
        Minneapolis learn to code and gain new skills in full-stack web development and data science. <br /><br />
        
        We host free workshops, info sessions, tech talks, and happy hours in Minneapolis every Tuesday and Wednesday from
        6:30pm-8:00pm. <br /><br />
        
        My responsibilities: <br />
        • Organize Meetup events with a goal of helping people gain new skills in full-stack web development and data science <br />
        • Reinforce lessons presented by the instructor by reviewing materials with attendees one-on-one or in small groups<br />
        • Meet and greet attendees and share my own experience as a Thinkful student</p>

        <p>I learned industry best practices and practical software development standards with a focus on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,
        jQuery, Node.js, React, Redux, and algorithms & data structures at Thinkful. <br /><br />
        As a full-stack web development apprentice, I created and deployed numerous mobile-first applications while learning new languages and frameworks by collaborating
        with other developers for several hours every day (spending ~40-60 hours a week). <br /><br /></p>

        <p>I provided general IT support to all 70,000+ internal employees worldwide and handled 30-50 tickets a day via phone and chat.<br /><br />
        Within the first year at U.S. Bank, I was given the role as a trainer & mentor position where I led multiple training courses for new hires and provided mentorship. Shortly after, I was promoted to the senior position where I assisted the executives and worked closely with other TOS groups to test new systems before the official rollout<br /><br /></p>
